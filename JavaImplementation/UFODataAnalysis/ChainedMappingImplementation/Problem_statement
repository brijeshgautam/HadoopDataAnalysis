This map-reduce job  extracts minimum , maximum and mean observed time for a given UFO shape object. UFO data consists of 6 fields. 

1. Sighting date: This field gives the date when the UFO sighting occurred.
2. Recorded date: This field gives the date when the sighting was reported, often different to the sighting date.
3. Location: This field gives the location where the sighting occurred.
4. Shape: This field gives a brief summary of the shape of the UFO, for example, diamond, lights, cylinder.
5. Duration: This field gives the duration of how long the sighting lasted.
6. Description: This field gives free text details of the sighting.

   This problem extracts time which are mentioned in seconds , in minutes or in hour terms. In case range of time is specified , then it extract 
lower value of range . After extracting time , it converts  in seconds, if required . Then  for each observed UFO shape, it computes minimum , 
maximum and mean observed time . 

This problem is implemented in terms of ChainedMapper. First mapper validates record and provides valid record to second mapper. Second mapper 
extracts shape and time and emits these values. Reducer does computation for a given shape.
