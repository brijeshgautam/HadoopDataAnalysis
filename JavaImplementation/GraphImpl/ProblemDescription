This programme computes distance of  each of the node in the graph from given starting node. Using counter mechanism in mapreduce framework, it computes distance in 
iterative way until no change in counter is noticed.  Input to this program is specified in  following way : 

node-id <tab-space> <comma-separeted-list of neighbours> < tab-space> <if starting node , then 0 as distance , for other node it is not specified> <tab-space>
<State of node, for starting node, it will be specified as  C, for remaining node nodes not specified.>


For example , atached  graph image , input file will be like : 

1 2,3,4	0	C
2	1,4
3	1,5,6
4	1,2
5	3,6
6	3,5
7	6
