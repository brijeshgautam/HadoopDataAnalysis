The implementation is part of Hadoop Beginner's Guide example. UFO  database comprises a series of UFO sighting records with the following fields: 

1. Sighting date: This field gives the date when the UFO sighting occurred.
2. Recorded date: This field gives the date when the sighting was reported, often different to the sighting date.
3. Location: This field gives the location where the sighting occurred.
4. Shape: This field gives a brief summary of the shape of the UFO, for example, diamond, lights, cylinder.
5. Duration: This field gives the duration of how long the sighting lasted.
6. Description: This field gives free text details of the sighting.

  In this Map-Reduce implementation,  Mapper extracts the  shape  type and  time of observation . Extracted time is in seconds. If dataset contains time in 
minutes or in  hour, Mapper converts this time into seconds. Reducer   computes   for a given shape minimum, maximum, mean  time. It also computes total time  
observed for a shape and  number of times given shape is observed.
